                <h4>Assembly and Testing of Simple Aurora Monitors in a Magnetically Noisy Environment</h4>
                <p>Our study focused on assembling and testing SAM instruments with magnetometer sensors to measure Earth's magnetic field. We aimed to distinguish natural field variations from noise caused by person-made technology.

                    Preliminary results indicated that magnetic noise overshadowed natural variations, emphasizing the need to address person-made disturbances for accurate data analysis.</p>
