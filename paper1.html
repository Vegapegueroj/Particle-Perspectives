                <p class="center">"Behavioral Study of Obedience"<br>by Jean Carlos Vega*1,2, Elizabeth Brennan1, and Kristin Simunac1,2​, 1. St. Petersburg College, 2. University of South Florida ​<br>Year: 2023</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
                <p>We received the instruments in a kit containing parts such as the circuit board, keyboard, LED screen, and fluxgate magnetometer sensors. Initially, we assembled the parts by soldering components onto the circuit board. Once constructed, each instrument had magnetometer sensors pointing along the x, y, and z axes to collect data. The sensors were tested individually and in tandem to observe sensitivity to sources of magnetic noise in a classroom or home environment to see if naturally occurring changes in the local magnetic field could be separated from the noise caused by person-made technology.  Preliminary results show noise dominating the natural field variations.</p>

                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>Geomagnetic storms happen due to the exchange of energy from the solar wind into our magnetosphere (NOAA SWPC, n.d.). Magnetometers are used for measuring the Earth’s magnetic field. The Simple Aurora Monitor (SAM) instruments we tested measure both the direction and strength of the field, recording changes at the locations of the sensors. The SAM instruments can also be disturbed by person-made objects and equipment in the local surroundings (Reeve, 2016). We tested multiple objects to characterize their magnetic noise so that it could be separated (i.e. removed) via data processing from the signals of naturally occurring geomagnetic events.  </p>

                <h2> MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>
                <p>Two SAM III kits​
                    Soldering station (and solder)​
                    Multimeter​
                    Hand tools such as needle nose plyers, wire stripper/cutter, saw, file, drill​
                    PVC pipe, joints, and glue (for sensor housing)​
                    Data cable (such as CAT5)​
                    Two laptop computers for data logging​
                    Sources of noise such as cell phone, tablet, other home electronics and bar magnets​
                    ​
                    We tested the two instruments with known sources of noise at varying distances to document and compare the responses of the sensors.  We also reviewed logged data from USGS magnetometer stations (https://www.usgs.gov/programs/geomagnetism/data) at Stennis Space Center (Mississippi) and San Juan, Puerto Rico to check for for evidence of natural geomagnetic activity during our test periods.​
                    The sensors (labeled as JV and EB) were placed in different areas of the room to see if both meters were seeing the same disturbances (noise or geomagnetic storms). Static offsets were applied to data from meter EB to normalize the baseline readings with sensor JV for ease of comparison between the two on-site instruments. ​</p>
                <h3>DATA</h3>
                <p>n the sample data shown here the two instruments were collecting data simultaneously at different locations within the same laboratory space (as shown below).  The JV sensor (data shown in blue) was located near the door to the lab where people walked around or sat nearby with personal electronic devices.  The EB sensor (data shown in orange) was on the opposite side of the room roughly 8 meters away and was left undisturbed during this test period.  ​
                    ​
                    The data collected in this trial stresses the importance of person-made disturbances around the magnetometers within the laboratory.  While the EB sensor sees small changes, the JV sensor recorded significant variations in the local magnetic field.  ​
                    ​
                    Differences in response function could be another source of the variation in the sample data shown, so follow up testing of the sensors (separately) with a fixed magnetic source is needed to confirm that both EB and JV have similar levels of sensitivity.</p>

                <h2>RESULTS AND NEXT STEPS</h2>

                <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                <p>The study demonstrates the efficacy of SAM instruments in measuring Earth's magnetic field in noisy environments. Future work will focus on improving noise filtering techniques to enhance data accuracy in extremely noisy areas.</p>
